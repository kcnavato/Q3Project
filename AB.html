Born in the Manila, Kevin has always been drawn to the power of technology and their ability to ease the human work. As a child, he would spend hours watching technological channels, his father engineering machines, often asking about robotics with his family and friends. In high school, Jane's robotic skills began to develop even further. He participated in robotic contests and workshops, and he was consistently recognized for competitiveness. His father encouraged him to pursue engineering as a career and even suggested that he start early and start on simple technology. Today, he is still currently a student and working on himself to have a brighter future. Outside of robotics, Kevin enjoys singing in Glee Club, reading, gaming, chess, and spending time with friends and family. He hopes to continue his passions throughout her high school career and beyond, eventually pursuing a career he wants.
